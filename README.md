# webserver

## Background
For my Software Engineering Capstone, I worked with three other UCLA students to build a webserver. We would switch off responsibilities each week, with one student per week being assigned the team lead (TL). Throughout the 10 weeks, we had 9 homeworks, and for homework 8, we were allowed to design our own addition to the project (see Design Doc (HW8) and PRD (HW8)).

## Notes
I am still adding the full homework specs to this repo. Source code will be added if I am granted permission to do so by the teaching team.
